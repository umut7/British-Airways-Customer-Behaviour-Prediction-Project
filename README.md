Machine Learning Model for Predictive Classification

This project involves building a predictive model using Random Forest to classify data based on specific features. The dataset includes various parameters such as sales channels, trip types, flight duration, and booking origins.

Project Overview
Model: Random Forest Classifier
Objective: Predict class labels based on the dataset features.
Accuracy: 85.59%
Key Results: High performance for class 0, but lower precision and recall for class 1.
Steps Involved
Data preprocessing (handling categorical variables, missing values, etc.)
Training a Random Forest model.
Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy and classification report metrics.
Visualizing the results and summarizing them in a PowerPoint slide.
